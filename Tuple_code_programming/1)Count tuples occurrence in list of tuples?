# tuple of numbers
numbers = (1, 3, 4, 1, 6 ,1 )
# counts the number of 1's in the tuple
count = numbers.count(1)
print('The count of 1 is:', count)
# counts the number of 7's in the tuple
count = numbers.count(7)
print('The count of 7 is:', count)

Output:
The count of 1 is: 3
The count of 7 is: 0

In the above example, we have used the count() method to count the number of times the elements 1 and 7 appear in the tuple.
Here, the tuple numbers tuple (1,3,4,1,6,1) contains three 1's and doesn't contain the number 7. Hence, its count in the tuple is 3 and 0 respectively.
